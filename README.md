bifurcation: compute logical bifurcation diagram
================================================

The aim of this project is to be able to compute the bifurcation diagram of a given multivalued logical function. To achieve this it computes the local neighbors of monotone multivalued functions.
This work is a follow-up of [functionhood](https://github.com/ptgm/functionhood), where it is proposed a procedure to compute the local neighborhood of a given monotone Boolean function.

How to use it?
--------------

To compile it you will need Java6 JDK and [maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

* grab the source from github
* run "mvn package assembly:single" to compile and package it. Please note the assembly:single to include all the dependencies ([GINsim](http://ginsim.org) and [bioLQM](http://github.com/colomoto/biolqm)) in the final jar package
* you can use the jar in the "target/" subdirectory.

You can either integrate the .jar file in your tool, or launch the program by command line, providing a GINsim model (.zginml file format) and the name of the component under study, as follows:

    java -jar bifurcation-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar model_file.zgiml ComponentName
